<h3><strong>Presenting the Cost-Effective Alternative to In-House IT Management</strong></h3>
<p class="lead">Our intelligent remote monitoring tools and 24/7 back-office services provide expert, cost-effective IT management to make sure your systems operate as required and deliver the ROI you expected. Key elements include:</p>
<h3><strong>Server Monitoring and Care</strong></h3>

<p class="lead">We utilize active-yet-unobtrusive software to track and analyze your server activity around the clock. When a system or function fails to work properly, an alert is generated and our team will immediately investigate the issue. Once we’ve identified the problem, we’ll take steps to fix it — remotely at first, and we’ll escalate our response as necessary.</p>

<h3><strong>Desktop Monitoring and Care</strong></h3>

<p class="lead">Our preventive maintenance service for desktops proactively and regimentally monitors and addresses common problems experienced by desktop users. Whether it’s viruses, spyware issues or installing patches, we handle it all — quietly and in the background while your employees get on with their daily tasks.</p>

<h3><strong>Mobile Device Management</strong></h3>

<p class="lead">With more companies looking for efficient, secure ways to incorporate their employees’ personally owned mobile devices into the workplace (also known as “BYOD — bring your own device”) we offer a response that answers all your needs. Our mobile device management (MDM) solution is the fastest, most comprehensive way to get devices configured for company access and to ensure that your organization’s data is secure on smartphones and tablets. As a fully integrated cloud platform, we simplify MDM with rapid deployment, as well as comprehensive visibility and control that spans across mobile devices, applications and documents.</p>

<h3><strong>Network and Security Assessments</strong></h3>

<p class="lead">How healthy is your overall network? On a regular basis, we’ll generate reports on the state of your systems, letting you know of any potential problems that fall outside safe parameters of our managed IT services. With these comprehensive assessments, you’ll always have the best information for choosing your most effective options.</p>

<p class="lead">What’s more, we continually build intelligence into our remote monitoring software by documenting the resolution to thousands of issues and incorporating them back into our software. And our expert technicians work around the clock to ensure your systems not only remain healthy, but also optimized for performance. Rest assured, our team is equipped to handle even the most complex and difficult problems.</p>
